<div class="note">
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> All extensions created using the <a class="link-https" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/">Add-on SDK</a> are bootstrapped! All the bootstrapping code is generated for you, so you don't really need to think about it. Not using the Add-on SDK? Read on...</p>
</div>
<p>Traditional extensions include <strong>overlays</strong>, wherein the application can load up XUL from the extension's package and automatically apply it atop its own UI. While this makes creating extensions that add to the application's user interface relatively easy, it means that updating, installing, or disabling an extension requires an application restart.</p>
<p>Gecko 2.0 {{ geckoRelease("2.0") }} introduces <strong>bootstrapped extensions</strong>. These are special extensions that, instead of using overlays to apply their user interface to the application, programmatically insert themselves into the application. This is done using a special script file that's included in the extension that contains functions the browser calls to command the extension to install, uninstall, start up, and shut down.</p>
<p>All the application does is call into this script file; the extension is responsible for adding and removing its user interface and handling any other setup and shutdown tasks it requires.</p>
<p>This article discusses how bootstrapped extensions work. See this tutorial on <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/How_to_convert_an_overlay_extension_to_restartless">converting from an overlay extension to restartless</a> for a practical step by step guide to migrating.</p>
<h2 id="The_startup_and_shutdown_process">The startup and shutdown process</h2>
<p>A key feature of bootstrapped extensions is that they must be able to be started up and shut down on demand by the application. When the extension's <code>startup()</code> function is called, it must manually inject its user interface and other behavior into the application. Similarly, when its <code>shutdown()</code> function is called, it must remove anything it's added to the application, as well as all references to any of its objects.</p>
<p>There are several scenarios in which the <code>startup()</code> function may be called; for example:</p>
<ul>
 <li>When the extension is first installed, assuming that it's both compatible with the application and is enabled.</li>
 <li>When the extension becomes enabled using the add-ons manager window.</li>
 <li>When the application is started up, if the extension is enabled and compatible with the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of when the <code>shutdown()</code> function may be called:</p>
<ul>
 <li>When the extension is uninstalled, if it's currently enabled.</li>
 <li>When the extension becomes disabled.</li>
 <li>When the user quits the application, if the extension is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chrome.manifest_in_bootstrapped_add-ons">chrome.manifest in bootstrapped add-ons</h3>
<p>You can use a <a href="/en-US/docs/Chrome_Registration"><code>chrome.manifest</code></a> file in bootstrapped add-ons to:</p>
<ol>
 <li>make your add-on's content available via a <code>chrome://</code> URL (using the <code>content</code>, <code>locale</code>, and <code>skin</code> instructions in the manifest);</li>
 <li>replace existing <code>chrome://</code> URIs with your content (using the <code>override</code> instruction).</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all <code>chrome.manifest</code> instructions are supported in bootstrapped add-ons, for example you still cannot register <a href="/en-US/docs/XUL_Overlays">XUL Overlays</a> from a bootstrapped add-on. See the <a href="/en-US/docs/Chrome_Registration"><code>chrome.manifest</code></a> documentation for details.</p>
<p>In Firefox 10 and later the <code>chrome.manifest</code> file located in the root of the add-on's XPI (i.e. a sibling of the <code>install.rdf</code>) is loaded automatically. In Firefox 8 and 9 you had to load/unload the manifest manually using {{ ifmethod("nsIComponentManager", "addBootstrappedManifestLocation") }} and {{ ifmethod("nsIComponentManager", "removeBootstrappedManifestLocation") }}. This feature was unavailable in Firefox versions before 8.</p>
<h3 id="Adding_user_interface_manually">Adding user interface manually</h3>
<p>If you decide to go ahead and try to develop a bootstrapped extension that modifies the application's user interface, here are a few suggestions to get you started.</p>
<p>You need to look up the relevant application UI elements by their ID by calling {{ domxref("document.getElementById()") }}, then manipulate them to inject your UI. For example, you can get access to the menu bar in Firefox with <code>document.getElementById("main-menubar")</code>.</p>
<p>Be sure that at shutdown time, you remove any user interface you've added.</p>
<h2 id="Creating_a_bootstrapped_extension">Creating a bootstrapped extension</h2>
<p>To mark an extension as bootstrappable, you need to add the following element to its <a href="/en-US/docs/Install_Manifests">install manifest</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;em:bootstrap&gt;true&lt;/em:bootstrap&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Then you need to add a <a href="/en-US/docs/Extensions/bootstrap.js"><code><strong>bootstrap.js</strong></code> file</a> that contains the required functions; this should be alongside the <a href="/en-US/docs/Install_Manifests"><code>install.rdf</code> file</a> in the extension's package.</p>
<h3 id="Backward_compatibility">Backward compatibility</h3>
<p>Because older versions of Firefox don't know about the <code>bootstrap</code> property or <code>bootstrap.js</code> file, it's not overly difficult to create an XPI that will work on both as a bootstrappable extension and as a traditional extension. Create your extension as a bootstrappable extension, then add the traditional overlays as well. Newer versions of Firefox will use the <code>bootstrap.js</code> script, ignoring the components and overlays, while older versions will use the overlays.</p>
<h2 id="Bootstrap_entry_points">Bootstrap entry points</h2>
<p>The <code>bootstrap.js</code> script should contain several specific functions, which are called by the browser to manage the extension. The script gets executed in a privileged sandbox, which is cached until the extension is shut down.</p>
<h3 id="startup">startup</h3>
<p>Called when the extension needs to start itself up. This happens at application launch time or when the extension is enabled after being disabled (or after it has been shut down in order to install an update. As such, this can be called many times during the lifetime of the application.</p>
<p>This is when your add-on should inject its UI, start up any tasks it may need running, and so forth.</p>

<h3 id="install">install</h3>
<p>Your bootstrap script must include an <code>install()</code> function, which the application calls before the first call to <code>startup()</code> after the extension is installed, upgraded, or downgraded.</p>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Note:</strong> This method is never called if the extension has never been started; for example, if an extension is installed but isn't compatible with the current version of the application, <code>install()</code> never gets called if it is uninstalled before becoming compatible. However, if the extension gets upgraded to a version that's compatible with the application, its <code>install()</code> function will be called at that time, before the first <code>startup()</code> call.</div>

<h3 id="uninstall">uninstall</h3>
<p>This function is called after the last call to <code>shutdown()</code> before a particular version of an extension is uninstalled. This will not be called if <code>install()</code> was never called.</p>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Note:</strong> It's important to keep in mind that <code>uninstall()</code> can be called even on extensions that are currently disabled, or are not compatible with the current application. Because of this, it's crucial that the function be implemented to gracefully handle APIs that may not be present in the application. This function will also not be called if a third-party application removes the extension while Firefox isn't running. Simply having code <code>function install() {} </code>IS NOT ENOUGH, if you have code in <code>uninstall </code>it will not run, you MUST run some code in the <code>install </code>function, at the least you must set arguments on the <code>install </code>function so like: <code>function install(aData, aReason) {}</code> then uninstall WILL WORK.</div>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Note:</strong> If you open addon manager and then click "Remove" on addon, it will not call uninstall function right away. Because it was soft uninstalled, as the "Undo" button is there. If you close addon manager or something to make that "Undo" button to go away then the hard uninstall takes place.</div>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Note:</strong> The uninstall function fires on downgrade and upgrade as well so you should make sure it is an uninstall by doing this:<br>
 <code>function uninstall(aData, aReason) {</code><br>
 <code>     if (aReason == ADDON_UNINSTALL) {</code><br>
 <code>          console.log('really uninstalling');</code><br>
 <code>     } else {</code><br>
 <code>          console.log('not a permanent uninstall, likely an upgrade or downgrade');</code><br>
 <code>     }</code><br>
 <code>}</code></div>

<div class="note">
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> An add-on may be upgraded/downgraded at application startup, in this case the <code>startup</code> method reason is <code>APP_STARTUP</code>, and the <code>oldVersion</code> property is not set.

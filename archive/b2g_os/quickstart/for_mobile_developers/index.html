 <p>If you are a native mobile platform developer, why should you look into developer open web apps? This article talks you through open web app advantages, and the basic steps required to create one.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p>For mobile application developers, the open web apps project offers these advantages:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Develop on a single technology stack (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) and deliver across all platforms, from smartphones to tablets to desktops.</li>
 <li><strong>Standards</strong>: The technology stack is defined by standards bodies (W3C and Ecma) that operate in the open, rather than by particular technology or platform vendors.</li>
 <li><strong>Freedom</strong>: You're not locked in to a vendor-controlled ecosystem. You can distribute your app through the Firefox Marketplace, your own website, or any other store based on Mozilla's open app store technology.</li>
 <li><strong>Reach</strong>: You have the potential to reach Firefox's 450 million desktop users, as well as users of other desktop browsers and mobile users.</li>
</ul>

  1. Develop your app using open Web technologies.</dt>
 <dd>
  You probably already know at least a bit about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The <a href="/en-US/learn">Learn</a> section of this website has resources to help you ramp up even more. As a mobile app developer, you already have a <a class="external" href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">Mobile First</a> approach to Web design.</dd>
 <dt>
  2. Add an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Manifest">app manifest</a>.</dt>
 <dd>
  All that inherently separates a Web app from a normal website is a single, JSON-format text file.</dd>
 <dt>
  3. Publish the app, either on your own site or in an app store (or both).</dt>
 <dd>
  Publishing it yourself requires <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/JavaScript_API">adding some code to your site to manage installing and updating the app</a> in users' browsers.</dd>
